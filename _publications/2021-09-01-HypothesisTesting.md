title: "Hypothesis Testing with Error Correction Models"

permalink: /publication/2021-HypothesisTesting
excerpt: "Grant and Lebo (2016) and Keele et al. (2016) clarify the conditions under which the popular general error correction model (GECM) can be used and interpreted easily: In a bivariate GECM the data must be integrated in order to rely on the error correction coefficient, `alpha^{*}_{1}`, to test cointegration and measure the rate of error correction between a single exogenous $x$ and a dependent variable, $y$. Here we demonstrate that even if the data are all integrated, the test on `alpha^{*}_{1}` is misunderstood when there is more than a single independent variable. The null hypothesis is that there is no cointegration between $y$ and any $x$ but the correct alternative hypothesis is that $y$ is cointegrated with at least one—but not necessarily more than one—of the $x$'s. A significant can occur when some $I(1)$ regressors are not cointegrated and the equation is not balanced. Thus, the correct limiting distributions of the right-hand-side long-run coefficients may be unknown. We use simulations to demonstrate the problem and then discuss implications for applied examples."
